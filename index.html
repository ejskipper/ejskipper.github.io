            This is a website which doesn't have any purpose. You can look at it if you want, but it probably won't tell
            you anything useful.

<h4>Things you won't learn on this website:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>How to write code</li>
    <li>Interesting coronavirus statistics</li>
    <li>Real news</li>
    <li>Fake news</li>
    <li>Biographical facts about the author</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content on the website</h2>
<p>Just some stuff that we might implement, if we feel like it</p>
<div>We might put a nav bar. It should probably have some dropdown menus and stuff</div>
<div>We might put a big hero image on the top of the site. It could be a carousel because that seems like a UX thing.
</div>

<div>
    <h3>And then some sections</h3>
    <p>
        Probably a series of sections which would contain information on stuff if this site actually contained any
        useful information.
